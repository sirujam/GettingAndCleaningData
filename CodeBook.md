## CodeBook

Data is stored in wide form.

### Method of tidying data
1. Read the dataset from test and training sets, feature lables (used for column) and activity label (used for Activity tagging).
2. Using bind_rows of dplyr package test and training sets are merged into three sets (subject set, measurement set, and activity set).
3. Using bind_cols all three sets are combined to one dataset. The dataset are in order Subject, Activity and measurements.
4. The columns are filtered with "mean()" and "std()" and stored in intermediate dataset.
5. Using normal indexing, activity labels are changed to descriptive name.
6. gsub is used to change labels names to make it descriptive and assigned to column.
7. The data is tidied using reshape2 function and stored to file in wide form.
